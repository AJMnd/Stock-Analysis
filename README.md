Green energy stock analysis

# *Overview of Project*: 
Provide an analysis on green energy, including hydro, geothermal, wind, and bio energy. His clients have invested all their funds in DAQO, a company that makes silicon wafer for solar panels. Steve would like to diversify his clientâ€™s investment in green energy stocks. So we have also made an annual financial analysis on other green energy. 


## *Results*: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Below is a comparison on the original script and the refactored script as well as performances between 2017 and 2018. We also provided the execution time of the original script and the refactored script. 
In 2017 there was a high return rate for DQ(199.4%), SEDG(184.5%), and ENPH(129.5%). However, in 2018 DQ had a negative return rate at -62.6% while ENPH had a return rate of 81.9% return. We would recommend investing in ENPH in the future.

## ***Summary:*** 
When we refactored the code, we encountered a few errors. When we added and removed code there were errors that kept surfacing as we introduced new code. It was a lengthy process, as we had to run the code and debug the code. 
One of the advantages of refactoring code is that your code will be more organized for you and the team working on it. You can easily go back and check your comments in the code to see where you can make changes. Which will provide a better quality of writing and delivering accurate results. 
One of the disadvantages of refactoring code is the potential for introducing bugs or errors that will need additional testing which can make the process much longer.
